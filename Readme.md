# What is this I don't even?

Welcome to Nooga Startups, a directory of the awesome startups located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was inspired by sites like [Made in New York](http://nytm.org/made/).

# Chatta-what?

[Chattanooga](http://goo.gl/maps/lb6o7), fondly known as the 'Noog, 'Nooga, or simply "The Paris of Southeast Tennessee". Chattanooga is home to a number of great startups, a fantastic outdoor scene, delicious food, and some great whiskey.

Interesting Facts about Chattanooga:
------------------------------------

 - The world's first coca-cola bottling plant opened here in 1899.
 - The annual [Riverbend Music Festival](http://www.riverbendfestival.com/) is consistently rated as one of the best festivals in the country.
 - World-class kayaking and climbing is located within thirty minutes of the city.
 - The country's first 1Gbps residential network, and the coverage stretches across the entire county.
 - Conveniently located ninety minutes from Atlanta, Nashville, Birmingham, and Knoxville. From country music concerts to the world's busiest international airport... it's all close.

# What's the point of this?

It's time to get the secret out... Chattanooga has an emerging tech scene, a thriving downtown, and a lot of energy and momentum. We want to make it easier for engineers, journalists & founders to see whats happening in Chattanooga and get more information about the movement.

Software is eating the world and the most successful economies of tomorrow are building around this. Our goal is for Chattanooga to be one of these economies and it's time to build the buzz and bring in the talent.
